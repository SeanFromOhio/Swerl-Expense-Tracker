# Swerl-Expense-Tracker
Expense tracker built on the Django framework. My first major unguided project, which taught me A LOT! Very proud of what I've built, and cannot wait to learn and build more.

# Technologies / Libraries:
1) Python - Django Framework
2) HTML
3) CSS
4) Javascript (small scripts)
5) Pandas (data management library)
6) Plotly (responsive & interactive plots library)

# What I learned:
1) A ton about Django and web development (APIs - server request / server response)
2) Understanding of how databases work, and how to manipulate data utilizing CRUD principles
3) I understand how files interact with eachother: User -> Path -> View -> User
4) I learned a lot about HTML & CSS
5) I learned about the power of Javascript & Jquery 
6) About keeping your code base neat and organized
7) And lots more!

# Future goals:
1) Make the project even more responsive for smaller resolutions, such as mobile.
2) Add more functionality for users to interact with the data (search through expenses, etc...)
3) Make graphs to still look neat even when fewer data points are given (1 point on line graph doesn't work well)
4) Overall UX and flow of the site
